Installation
============

Installing vcf2fhir is pretty simple. Here is a step by step plan on how to do it.

.. note::
    vcf2fhir is available on Pypi as ``vcf2fhir``.

First, obtain Python_ and virtualenv_ if you do not already have them. Using a
virtual environment will make the installation easier, and will help to avoid
clutter in your system-wide libraries. You will also need Git_ in order to
clone the repository.

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
.. _virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
.. _Git: http://git-scm.com/

Once you have these, create a virtual environment somewhere on your disk, then
activate it::

    virtualenv vcf2fhir
    source vcf2fhir/bin/activate


    pip install vcf2fhir


This will give install vcf2fhir library.
